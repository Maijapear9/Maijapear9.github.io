	<h1><center>Hello World</center></h1>	
	<p> Here is a website that will show my progress on my Projects for Creation 101</p> 
	<h2> Week 1 </h2>
	<p> I set up this website through GitHub and help from my brother LeRoyce, Yay!</p>
	<h2> Week 2: Laser Cutting </h2>
	<p> We were told to make something on a laser cutter, so naturally I made a cat! I searched on google for a template of a cat and found this handy <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Cut-Cat/"> one <a/>I then sent it to the laser cutter through Glowforge and it did its business and voila! Cat! *His Name is Damien*</p>

	</div>
	<h2> Week 3: Electronics Production </h2>
	<p> I attended a lecture on making PCB boards. Then was given a template of a board to design on Eagle. I played around with the design and sent it to the Lab to be printed. Then I spent 3 hours soldering on all the tiiiiny little components. Here is the finished product. </p>

	<h1><center> Final Project Idea</center></h1>
	<p> A Creepy Halloween Doll that tracks motion</p>
    <img src="https://libreshot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/doll.jpg" id="Doll">	
	<p> The doll will have a motion tracker in the head. As people walk up the sidewalk the doll's eyes and head will track them. I may end up having the doll on a motor powered tricycle that will drive forward if a person is close enough. We will see where this idea goes. </p>
